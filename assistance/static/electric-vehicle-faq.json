            "question": "How do electric vehicle batteries work?",
            "answer": "Electric vehicle batteries store electrical energy in chemical form and convert it to electrical energy to power the motor. Most modern EVs use lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have high energy density. The battery pack consists of multiple cells connected in series and parallel to provide the necessary voltage and capacity."

            "question": "What is regenerative braking and how does it work?",
            "answer": "Regenerative braking captures energy that would normally be lost during braking and converts it back into electrical energy to recharge the battery. When the driver applies the brakes, the electric motor operates in reverse, acting as a generator that slows the vehicle while producing electricity."

            "question": "What are the different types of EV charging?",
            "answer": "There are three levels of EV charging: Level 1 (120V household outlet, slowest charging), Level 2 (240V, commonly found at homes and public stations), and DC Fast Charging (50kW-350kW, for rapid charging on road trips). Charging speed decreases significantly as the battery approaches full capacity."

            "question": "How long does it take to charge an electric vehicle?",
            "answer": "Charging time varies by battery size and charging level. Level 1: 40-80 hours for full charge, Level 2: 4-10 hours, DC Fast Charging: 20-40 minutes to 80%. Charging slows significantly after 80% due to battery protection systems. Most EV owners charge overnight at home using Level 2."

            "question": "What is the cost of charging an electric vehicle?",
            "answer": "Home charging costs approximately $0.03-$0.06 per mile (based on $0.13-$0.18 per kWh electricity rates). Public charging costs vary: Level 2 at $0.30-$0.50 per kWh, DC Fast Charging at $0.40-$0.70 per kWh. This is significantly less than gasoline costs per mile."

            "question": "How long do electric vehicle batteries last?",
            "answer": "Most EV manufacturers warrant their batteries for 8 years or 100,000 miles. Studies suggest that EV batteries retain 90%+ of their capacity after 8 years of use. Factors affecting battery life include temperature, charging habits, and depth of discharge. Battery replacement costs are decreasing rapidly."

            "question": "What affects electric vehicle battery life?",
            "answer": "Temperature extremes, frequent fast charging, consistently charging to 100% or discharging to 0%, and high mileage can reduce battery life. Many EVs include thermal management systems to maintain optimal battery temperature. Partial charging (20-80%) is gentler on batteries than full cycles."

            "id": "battery_003",
            "question": "What happens to used EV batteries?",
            "answer": "EV batteries can be repurposed for stationary energy storage after vehicle use, extending their useful life. Eventually, they're recycled to recover valuable materials like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Battery recycling technology is improving, with some facilities recovering over 95% of materials."

            "question": "How does cold weather affect electric vehicle performance?",
            "answer": "Cold weather reduces EV range by 15-40% due to increased energy needs for cabin heating and reduced battery efficiency. Battery pre-conditioning while plugged in helps preserve range. Regenerative braking efficiency also decreases in cold weather. Some EVs have heated battery packs to mitigate these effects."

            "question": "What is the maintenance requirement for electric vehicles?",
            "answer": "EVs require significantly less maintenance than gasoline vehicles: no oil changes, fewer brake replacements due to regenerative braking, and fewer moving parts. Maintenance typically involves tires, brake fluid, cabin air filters, and periodic software updates. Overall maintenance costs are 30-50% lower."

            "question": "What is the environmental impact of electric vehicles?",
            "answer": "EVs produce zero direct emissions and significantly lower lifecycle emissions than gasoline vehicles, even when accounting for electricity generation. Over the vehicle's lifetime, EVs typically produce 50-70% fewer emissions than comparable gasoline cars. The environmental benefit increases as the electrical grid becomes cleaner."

            "question": "How sustainable is EV battery production?",
            "answer": "Battery production is energy-intensive and requires mining of lithium, cobalt, and rare earth elements. However, manufacturers are developing more sustainable practices: recycling programs, alternative materials, and cleaner production methods. The environmental impact is offset within 6-24 months of driving compared to gasoline cars."

            "question": "What is the total cost of ownership for electric vehicles?",
            "answer": "Despite higher upfront costs, EVs typically have lower total cost of ownership due to lower fuel and maintenance costs. Electricity costs are 1/3 to 1/2 of gasoline costs per mile. Maintenance savings can be $4,000-$10,000 over the vehicle's lifetime. Many regions offer tax incentives for EV purchases."
